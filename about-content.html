    <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold text-purple-400">About Me</h1>
  
    <p>
      Hey, I'm <strong class="text-purple-300">Marius Mörsch</strong>, 32 years old, based in Berlin, and I recently completed my education as a <strong>Programmer &
         Game Designer</strong> at <em>Games Academy</em>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Over the past two years, I’ve immersed myself in the world of game development — learning workflows, experimenting
       with game design, and leveling up my technical skills. Originally, I only wanted to focus on design. But I quickly realized
        that learning to code would make me a stronger designer. Now? I’m hooked on <strong class="text-purple-300">prototyping</strong> and passionate about
         <strong class="text-purple-300">tech design</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      One of the things I value most is the <strong>network and collaboration</strong> I built during my studies. I worked closely with a tech-
      savvy producer across multiple projects, learning a lot about <strong>production workflows</strong> and <strong>project management</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Whether it was card games, board games, my GameBoy, the PS1, or my first own PC — I’ve always been passionate 
      about games of all kinds. I kept writing down stories, riddles, game mechanics — not because I had to, but because I 
      couldn’t help it.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Eventually I looked at my 50+ page idea doc and thought: “It’s time to do something with this.” So I moved to Berlin 
      and joined Games Academy to start building something real.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      My goal? To contribute something meaningful to the gaming world. Whether it’s my own game or as part of a team — I 
      want to create experiences that stay with players.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I’m calm under pressure, curious by nature, and always excited to learn new tools or try out fresh mechanics. I love 
      understanding <strong>why</strong> things work — not just how.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      My most played games? <strong>League of Legends</strong>, <strong>World of Warcraft</strong>, and <strong>Titan Quest</strong>. I love games where you level up,
       improve gear, and build a unique journey. But I also enjoy co-op strategy like <em>Stellaris</em>, <em>Warhammer</em>, or quirky 
       adventures like <em>Deponia</em>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I thrive working solo or in creative teams. I believe in clear goals, smooth workflows, and celebrating milestones 
      together.
